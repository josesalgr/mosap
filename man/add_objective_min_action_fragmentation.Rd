\title{Add objective: minimize action fragmentation}
\usage{
add_objective_min_action_fragmentation(
  x,
  relation_name = "boundary",
  weight_multiplier = 1,
  action_weights = NULL,
  actions = NULL,
  alias = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{Data} object created with \code{\link{inputData}} or \code{\link{inputDataSpatial}}.}

\item{relation_name}{Character. Name of the spatial relation in \code{x$data$spatial_relations}.}

\item{weight_multiplier}{Numeric \eqn{\ge 0}. Multiplier applied to all relation weights. Default \code{1}.}

\item{action_weights}{Optional action weights. Either a named numeric vector (names = action ids)
or a \code{data.frame(action, weight)}.}

\item{actions}{Optional subset of action ids to include in the objective.}

\item{alias}{Character scalar or \code{NULL}. Optional identifier to register this objective
as an atomic objective for multi-objective workflows.}
}
\value{
The updated \code{Data} object.
}
\description{
Specify an objective that minimizes fragmentation at the action level over a spatial relation.
This objective is intended for models where action allocations (rather than only PU selection)
drive spatial cohesion.

This function is \strong{data-only}: it stores the objective specification inside the
\code{Data} object so it can be materialized later when the optimization model is built.

If \code{alias} is provided, the objective is also registered in \code{x$data$objectives}
as an atomic objective for multi-objective workflows.
}
\details{
Action-level fragmentation can optionally weight actions differently via \code{action_weights}
and can optionally restrict the objective to a subset of actions via \code{actions}.
The exact linearization and interpretation are implemented in the model builder.
