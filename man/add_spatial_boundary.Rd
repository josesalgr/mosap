\title{Add spatial boundary-length relations from sf polygons OR a boundary table}
\usage{
add_spatial_boundary(
  x,
  boundary = NULL,
  pu_sf = NULL,
  name = "boundary",
  weight_col = NULL,
  weight_multiplier = 1,
  progress = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data object.}

\item{boundary}{Optional data.frame with columns (id1,id2,boundary) or (pu1,pu2,weight).}

\item{pu_sf}{Optional sf with PU polygons and an \code{id} column. If NULL, uses x$data$pu_sf.}

\item{name}{Name to store relation under (default "boundary").}

\item{weight_col}{For boundary tables, which column to use as weight. Defaults to "boundary" or "weight".}

\item{weight_multiplier}{Multiplier applied to computed/loaded weights.}

\item{progress}{Show basic progress for large N (logical).}
}
\description{
Registers a boundary-length relation between planning units.
\itemize{
\item If \code{boundary} is provided: uses it (expects id1/id2/boundary or pu1/pu2/weight).
\item If \code{boundary} is NULL: derives boundary lengths from \code{pu_sf} (or x$data$pu_sf).
}

This function defines \emph{boundary} (shared-edge length), not queen touches.
