\title{Add objective: minimize intervention fragmentation}
\usage{
add_objective_min_intervention_fragmentation(
  x,
  relation_name = "boundary",
  weight_multiplier = 1,
  alias = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{Data} object created with \code{\link{inputData}} or \code{\link{inputDataSpatial}}.}

\item{relation_name}{Character. Name of the spatial relation in \code{x$data$spatial_relations}.}

\item{weight_multiplier}{Numeric \eqn{\ge 0}. Multiplier applied to all relation weights. Default \code{1}.}

\item{alias}{Character scalar or \code{NULL}. Optional identifier to register this objective
as an atomic objective for multi-objective workflows.}
}
\value{
The updated \code{Data} object.
}
\description{
Specify an objective that minimizes fragmentation at the intervention level over a spatial relation.
This objective is intended for models where interventions represent a coarser grouping of actions,
and spatial cohesion is evaluated at that grouping level.

This function is \strong{data-only}: it stores the objective specification inside the
\code{Data} object so it can be materialized later when the optimization model is built.

If \code{alias} is provided, the objective is also registered in \code{x$data$objectives}
as an atomic objective for multi-objective workflows.
