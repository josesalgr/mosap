\description{
Internal helper used by objective setter functions to optionally register an objective
as an \emph{atomic objective} for multi-objective workflows.

If \code{alias} is non-\code{NULL}, the objective definition is stored in
\code{x$data$objectives[[alias]]}. This allows external multi-objective orchestration
(e.g., weighted sum, \eqn{\epsilon}-constraint, AUGMECON, interactive methods) to refer to
objectives by a stable user-facing identifier.

The function is fully backward compatible with single-objective workflows: when
\code{alias} is \code{NULL}, no entry is added to \code{x$data$objectives} and only the
active single-objective specification stored in \code{x$data$model_args} (set by the calling
objective setter) is used.

Specify an objective that minimizes total costs associated with the solution.
Costs may include planning-unit costs and/or action costs depending on the flags provided.

This function is \strong{data-only}: it stores the objective specification inside the
\code{Data} object so it can be materialized later when the optimization model is built
(typically when calling \code{solve()}).

If \code{alias} is provided, the objective is also registered in \code{x$data$objectives}
as an atomic objective for multi-objective workflows, while preserving the legacy
single-objective behavior (the most recently set objective remains the active one in
\code{x$data$model_args}).
}
\details{
The function updates \code{x$data$model_args} with:
\describe{
\item{\code{model_type}}{\code{"minimizeCosts"}}
\item{\code{objective_id}}{\code{"min_cost"}}
\item{\code{objective_args}}{a list with \code{include_pu_cost} and \code{include_action_cost}}
}

The model builder must interpret these fields to set the objective coefficients.
