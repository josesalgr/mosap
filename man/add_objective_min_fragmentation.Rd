\title{Add objective: minimize fragmentation (PU cut)}
\usage{
add_objective_min_fragmentation(
  x,
  relation_name = "boundary",
  weight_multiplier = 1,
  alias = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{Data} object created with \code{\link{inputData}} or \code{\link{inputDataSpatial}}.}

\item{relation_name}{Character. Name of the spatial relation in \code{x$data$spatial_relations}
(e.g., \code{"boundary"}, \code{"rook"}, \code{"queen"}, \code{"knn"}). Default \code{"boundary"}.}

\item{weight_multiplier}{Numeric \eqn{\ge 0}. Multiplier applied to all relation weights. Default \code{1}.}

\item{alias}{Character scalar or \code{NULL}. Optional identifier to register this objective
as an atomic objective for multi-objective workflows.}
}
\value{
The updated \code{Data} object.
}
\description{
Specify an objective that minimizes spatial fragmentation measured as the weighted cut
between selected and non-selected planning units over a spatial relation:
\deqn{\sum_{(i,j)} w_{ij}\,|z_i - z_j|.}

In the model builder, this objective is linearized using auxiliary edge variables.
Relation weights \eqn{w_{ij}} are read from \code{x$data$spatial_relations[[relation_name]]}
and can be scaled by \code{weight_multiplier} (BLM-like scaling).

This function is \strong{data-only}: it stores the objective specification inside the
\code{Data} object so it can be materialized later when the optimization model is built.

If \code{alias} is provided, the objective is also registered in \code{x$data$objectives}
as an atomic objective for multi-objective workflows.
